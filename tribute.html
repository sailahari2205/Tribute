                    Swami Vivekananda, born as Narendra Nath Datta on January 12,
                    1863, was a renowned Indian monk, philosopher, and social reformer. 
                    He played a significant role in revitalizing Hinduism and spreading 
                    Vedanta philosophy in the late 19th century. Vivekananda's life story
                    is characterized by his deep spiritual quest, intellectual brilliance, 
                    and relentless dedication to the upliftment of humanity.

                    Early Life: <br>
                    Narendra Nath Datta was born in Kolkata (then Calcutta) in a 
                    traditional Bengali family. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was 
                    a successful attorney, while his mother, Bhuvaneshwari Devi, 
                    was a pious and compassionate woman. From an early age, Narendra 
                    displayed extraordinary intellectual abilities and a curious mind.

                <p>
                    Encounter with Ramakrishna: <br>
                    In his youth, Narendra Nath met Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, 
                    a mystic and spiritual teacher, who would profoundly influence 
                    his life. Under Ramakrishna's guidance, Narendra underwent 
                    intense spiritual practices, exploring various paths and 
                    experiences. Ramakrishna recognized Narendra's potential and 
                    predicted that he would play a crucial role in the spiritual 
                    and social awakening of India.

                <p>
                    Formation of the Ramakrishna Mission: <br>
                    After the passing of Ramakrishna, Narendra Nath and a group of 
                    disciples founded the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897. The mission 
                    aimed to promote the principles and teachings of Ramakrishna, 
                    foster religious harmony, and provide service to society. 
                    Vivekananda's vision was to combine spirituality with social 
                    service, recognizing the importance of addressing the practical 
                    needs of people alongside their spiritual upliftment.
